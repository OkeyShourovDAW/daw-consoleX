#INTRODUCTION OF THE TOOL >>
 
                           This tool is a console like metasploit but it's not metasploit.This tools is designed and developed
        by OKEY_shourov.This tool is yet in developing stage at version~ 2.0 (free) edition.This tool is lot more faster than any other 
        tool in the market.This tool make hacking easy.Various kinds of tools are preloaded into it.A lot of modules and attacks are 
        loaded into this tool.And yes this tool also contains a security login page to get into it.

#HOW TO KNOW THIS TOOL IS ORIGINAL >>
 
                                     *We really care about you,bcz we know you want to get original tools and we know that you 
                         do not want any malware with  the tools.So,we uses some security in our tool.We are using Developer-code and 
                         Serial-Product.SO notice this things.And we also improve our security login page.and also uses the "checksum"
                         md5 hash.
                         To check that we include the "checksum" tool into this tool saperatly.
                 HOW TO CHECK THE SHECKSUM md5 hash?

                                1~ apt-get install wine && apt-get install wine32
                                2~ chmod +x WinMD5.exe
                                3~ wine WinMD5.exe
                                4~ after opening the WinMD5 tool just DRAG & DROP THE "daw-consolexBeta-2.0.zip" this file into the box beside the 'Browse' or you can Browse and select "daw-consolexBeta-2.0.zip" this file.
                                5~ now you can see a md5 hash under the box.
                                6~ THE HASH WILL  BE = 12fb94c62bd06a9ac1537aaf48e8f220 
                          (IF THIS HASH matched with your checksum hash then your daw-consolex tool is original.If the hash reasult is different from this hash "12fb94c62bd06a9ac1537aaf48e8f220" then the tool is fake or virus effected)
                                7~ The md5 hash "12fb94c62bd06a9ac1537aaf48e8f220" also will be in the github site description.

                                    (OCTA-Coding is under beta 1 and super-OCTA-Coding is under beta 1)

#WHAT IS OCTA-Coding & super-OCTA-Coding >>
                      
                        OCTA-Coding is a new code mood under daw.It works like machin learning via coding.It will automically detects 
                 What types of power or performance needed in the system.And make a smother and faster perfomance than before and The OCTA-Coding is only works for 32bit processors and OS. But thats not enough we also included super-OCTA-Coding for 64bit processors and OS to get the perfect performance via using less power and space. And this both OCTA-Coding and super-OCTA-Coding detects themselvs automically in various bits processors and OS, so you do not have to worry about it.
